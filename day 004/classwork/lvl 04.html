    <!-- writeing information -->
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed<br>
         to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It <br>
         is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages <br>
         such as JavaScript.<br>
        
       Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents<br>
     into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally <br>
     included cues for its appearance.<br>
        
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects <br>
    such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <br>
    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <br>
    links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
