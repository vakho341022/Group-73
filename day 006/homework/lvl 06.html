<p>Georgia is a country in the Caucasus region on the coast of the Black Sea. It is located at the<br>
intersection of Eastern Europe and West Asia, and is today generally regarded as part of<br>
Europe. It is bordered to the north and northeast by Russia, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to<br>
 the southeast by Azerbaijan. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi). It<br>
  has a population of 3.9 million, of which over a third live in the capital and largest city,<br>
  Tbilisi. Ethnic Georgians, who are native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's <br>
  population and are its titular nation.<br>
  <br>
Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, <br>
gold mining, and textiles. The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as <br>
Colchis and Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century,<br>
Georgians officially adopted Christianity, which contributed to their unification under the Kingdom of<br>
Georgia. Georgia reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV <br>
and Queen Tamar. Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated due to internal <br>
discord and pressure from various regional powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia,<br>
 before being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in 1801.<br>
<br>
 After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German<br>
 protection. However, the country was invaded and annexed by the Red Army in 1921; it then became<br>
  one of the republics of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, leading<br>
   to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the <br>
   country endured economic crises, political instability, and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South <br>
   Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western<br>
    foreign policy, introducing a series of reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO.<br>
     This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian<br>
     War of 2008 and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.<br></p>
